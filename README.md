# railway-rank-bot-v1
Mainly a fork of another bot on [glitch](https://glitch.me). This can work on [railway](railway.app) and [render](render.com) long as you know how to work your way around a cloud application website.

Refer to this [tutorial](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-create-a-rank-management-system-using-glitch/442725) to set up.
